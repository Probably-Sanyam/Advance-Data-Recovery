# Advance-Data-Recovery
In this project, i recovered data from a damaged hard drive by replacing its read/write head assembly with one from a donor drive.
It is a temporary solution, means if your drive is working after replacement it does not mean it will keep on working
You got limited time, Recover the data as quick as possible and say goodbye to your Drive.
